Implemented the game [Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Rock,-Paper,-Scissors) in JavaScript. Originally the game was implemented such that it was played entirely in the console where the user was prompted for human input and the computer randomly chose "rock", "paper" or "scissors". Human and Computer scores were updated after each round of play. The game would play 5 rounds and after that the final winner was announced. 

In this current version, a very basic UI is implemented where user is no loger prompted for input. Instead three buttons are added to choose "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors". In the previous version the results were in the console, however, now the results are displayed in the DOM. The logic to play exactly five rounds is removed. Once one player reaches five points the game announces the Final winner.
